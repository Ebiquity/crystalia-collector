## Item-001
### Input
```yaml
id: cryd:item-01
label: file-1

```
## Method-MD5
### Input
```yaml
comment: MD5 is a widely used hash algorithm that generates a 128-bit hash value from
  a variable-length input. It is known for its speed and efficiency, making it suitable
  for various applications, including digital signatures and checksums.
id: cryd:method-md5
label: MD5
robustness: VERY_HIGH

```
## Method-SHA1
### Input
```yaml
comment: SHA1 is a widely used hash algorithm that generates a 160-bit hash value
  from a variable-length input. It is known for its speed and efficiency, making it
  suitable for various applications, including digital signatures and checksums.
id: cryd:method-sha1
label: SHA1
robustness: EXTREMELY_HIGH

```
## Method-SHA256
### Input
```yaml
comment: SHA256 is a widely used hash algorithm that generates a 256-bit hash value
  from a variable-length input. The long signature makes it more resilient against
  forgery  attempts compared to hash algorithms with shorter signatures.
id: cryd:method-sha256
label: SHA256
robustness: EXTREMELY_HIGH

```
## Item-001
### Input
```yaml
id: cryd:item-02

```
